# Lecture Two Summary

### Dependencies
- Flow
   - Structural, Data, Controll Hazards
- Output
   - ???
- Anti
   - Flipping order of instructions would cause program inconsistences.
   
### Multi-Cycle Instructions
Instruction can take a variable amount of time at each box. Class convention:
- mul.d takes four X cycles

### Loop Timing
Loop cycle = completeion of D-box for bne instruction.

loop cycle * number of iteration - 1 + the maximum duration of the loop.
